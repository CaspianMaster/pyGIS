    "# Setting up Python for Geospatial on Mac, Windows, and Linux\n",
    "Geospatial analysis requires a pretty broad set of python modules and with it, comes a lot of dependencies. And to be honest, the only thing Python doesn't do well with, is dependencies. Luckily we have a few tricks up our sleeves to help you get to work fast. \n",

    "## Docker for Geospatial Python - GDAL Included\n",
    "Docker allows us to essentially package and share operating systems with specific modifications. Importantly for us this includes libraries and dependencies that are difficult to install otherwise (I'm looking at you GDAL). Before we start you should familiarize yourself with the basic concepts behind Docker, please read the following: [a simple intro to Docker concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/docker-defined)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get this done we will be accessing [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), which allows coders like us to store their Docker images. We will be downloading an image of the Linux operating system (Ubuntu, which is \"debian-based\"), that already has GDAL built for us. Once we \"pull\" a copy of the image of this operating system we will open it as \"a container\". This \"container\" is a running instance of the \"image\" that we can run our applications on, and customize for our use case.  Read some more on [\"images\" vs \"containers\" etc here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/docker-containers-images-registries).\n",
